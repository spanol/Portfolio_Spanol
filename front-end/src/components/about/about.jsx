            My favorite language is JavaScript and i love the React framework

            I've already studied in the Blue Edtech (and im still) and i've
            studied in the SÃ£o Judas Tadeu university. In those, i've studied:
            OOP concepts, Progamming logic, Data Structures, Algorithms, and
            more. I really love to learn new things and would be happy to learn
            a new language or neu technology.
